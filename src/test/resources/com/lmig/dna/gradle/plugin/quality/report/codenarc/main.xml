A method (or "closure field") with an ABC score greater than the maxMethodAbcScore property (60) causes a violation.

If that property is null or empty, then this rule is not applied (i.e., it does nothing). It defaults to null, so this rule must be explicitly configured to be active. This rule ignores interfaces.]]></Description></Rule><Rule name='AbstractClassWithPublicConstructor'><Description><![CDATA[Checks for abstract classes that define a public constructor, which is useless and confusing.]]></Description></Rule><Rule name='AbstractClassWithoutAbstractMethod'><Description><![CDATA[The abstract class does not contain any abstract methods. An abstract class suggests an incomplete implementation, which is to be completed by subclasses implementing the abstract methods. If the class is intended to be used as a base class only (not to be instantiated direcly) a protected constructor can be provided prevent direct instantiation.]]></Description></Rule><Rule name='AddEmptyString'><Description><![CDATA[Finds empty string literals which are being added. This is an inefficient way to convert any type to a String.]]></Description></Rule><Rule name='AssertWithinFinallyBlock'><Description><![CDATA[Checks for assert statements within a finally block. An assert can throw an exception, hiding the original exception, if there is one.]]></Description></Rule><Rule name='AssignCollectionSort'><Description><![CDATA[The Collections.sort() method mutates the list and returns the list as a value. If you are assigning the result of sort() to a variable, then you probably don't realize that you're also modifying the original list as well. This is frequently the cause of subtle bugs.]]></Description></Rule><Rule name='AssignCollectionUnique'><Description><![CDATA[The Collections.unique() method mutates the list and returns the list as a value. If you are assigning the result of unique() to a variable, then you probably don't realize that you're also modifying the original list as well.

It is often mistakenly used to attempt to read user input or parse a String into a boolean. It is a poor piece of API to use; replace it with System.properties['prop'].]]></Description></Rule><Rule name='BooleanMethodReturnsNull'><Description><![CDATA[Method with Boolean return type returns explicit null. A method that returns either Boolean.TRUE, Boolean.FALSE or null is an accident waiting to happen. This method can be invoked as though it returned a value of type boolean, and the compiler will insert automatic unboxing of the Boolean value. If a null value is returned, this will result in a NullPointerException.]]></Description></Rule><Rule name='BracesForClass'><Description><![CDATA[Checks the location of the opening brace ({) for classes.

If this code is intending to check for oddness, consider using x &amp; 1 == 1, or x % 2 != 0.]]></Description></Rule><Rule name='BuilderMethodWithSideEffects'><Description><![CDATA[A builder method is defined as one that creates objects. As such, they should never be of void return type. If a method is named build, create, or make, then it should always return a value.]]></Description></Rule><Rule name='BusyWait'><Description><![CDATA[Busy waiting (forcing a Thread.sleep() while waiting on a condition) should be avoided.

Tests should be isolated, and not be dependent on one another.]]></Description></Rule><Rule name='ClassForName'><Description><![CDATA[Using Class.forName(...) is a common way to add dynamic behavior to a system. However, using this method can cause resource leaks because the classes can be pinned in memory for long periods of time.]]></Description></Rule><Rule name='ClassJavadoc'><Description><![CDATA[Makes sure each class and interface definition is preceded by javadoc.

Use collectNested instead{}.]]></Description></Rule><Rule name='CompareToWithoutComparable'><Description><![CDATA[If you implement a compareTo method then you should also implement the Comparable interface.

This is an issue fixed in Groovy 1.8 but present in previous versions.]]></Description></Rule><Rule name='ComparisonOfTwoConstants'><Description><![CDATA[Checks for expressions where a comparison operator or equals() or compareTo() is used to compare two constants to each other or two literals that contain only constant values, e.g.: 23 == 67, Boolean.FALSE != false, 0.17 &lt;= 0.99, "abc" &gt; "ddd", [a:1] &lt;=&gt; [a:2], [1,2].equals([3,4]) or [a:false, b:true].compareTo(['a':34.5, b:Boolean.TRUE], where x is a variable.]]></Description></Rule><Rule name='ComparisonWithSelf'><Description><![CDATA[Checks for expressions where a comparison operator or equals() or compareTo() is used to compare a variable to itself, e.g.: x == x, x != x, x &lt;=&gt; x, x &lt; x, x &gt;= x, x.equals(x) or x.compareTo(x), where x is a variable.]]></Description></Rule><Rule name='ConfusingClassNamedException'><Description><![CDATA[This class is not derived from another exception, but ends with 'Exception'. This will be confusing to users of this class.]]></Description></Rule><Rule name='ConfusingMethodName'><Description><![CDATA[Checks for confusing method names. The referenced methods have names that differ only by capitalization. This is very confusing because if the capitalization were identical then one of the methods would override the other.]]></Description></Rule><Rule name='ConfusingMultipleReturns'><Description><![CDATA[Multiple return values can be used to set several variables at once. To use multiple return values, the left hand side of the assignment must be enclosed in parenthesis. If not, then you are not using multiple return values, you're only assigning the last element.]]></Description></Rule><Rule name='ConfusingTernary'><Description><![CDATA[In a ternary expression avoid negation in the test. For example, rephrase: "(x != y) ? diff : same" as: "(x == y) ? same : diff". Consistent use of this rule makes the code easier to read. Also, this resolves trivial ordering problems, such as "does the error case go first?" or "does the common case go first?".]]></Description></Rule><Rule name='ConsecutiveBlankLines'><Description><![CDATA[Makes sure there are no consecutive lines that are either blank or whitespace only.]]></Description></Rule><Rule name='ConsecutiveLiteralAppends'><Description><![CDATA[Violations occur when method calls to append(Object) are chained together with literals as parameters.

If you require shared logic in test cases then extract that logic to a new class where it can properly be reused.]]></Description></Rule><Rule name='CyclomaticComplexity'><Description><![CDATA[Checks the cyclomatic complexity for methods/classes.A method (or "closure field") with a cyclomatic complexity value greater than the maxMethodComplexity property (20) causes a violation.
